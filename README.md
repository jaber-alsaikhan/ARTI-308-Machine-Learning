Machine Learning
"I am developing a machine learning model designed to detect and filter spam and phishing attempts. The program analyzes email datasets to identify patterns used by attackers in targeted social engineering campaigns. By leveraging classification algorithms, the tool aims to protect sensitive corporate data from unauthorized access by flagging malicious emails before they can deceive the recipient."
