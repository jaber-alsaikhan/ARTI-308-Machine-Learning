 Feature Engineering (Classification)
## Order Status Prediction using a Talabat-style Orders Dataset

### Lab focus
This dataset is already clean (no missing values, no duplicate rows, consistent data types).  
In this lab, we focus on **feature engineering** for a classification task, not on data cleaning.

### Objective
Build a baseline model to predict `Order_Status` (Delivered, Cancelled, In Transit) and learn how feature engineering choices affect model performance and feature importance.

In this lab we will:
1) Load and inspect the dataset  
2) Define the target and select usable predictors (avoid leakage features)  
3) Engineer new features (time-based, price-based, distance-based)  
4) Encode categorical features  
5) Train a baseline **Random Forest** classifier  
6) Interpret performance and feature importance
